<P><A NAME="Encrypting">Encrypting a file</P>
<P></A>The program is simple to use. Click on the "Browse" button to find a file you would like to encrypt. When found, it will show up in the bigger window for you to review and see if it's the right file. If so, click on "Encipher" and a password box will show up. In order to prevent misspellings in the password, it must be entered twice. No-one can see the password you type, thus ensuring privacy. Depending on the length of the file chosen and your system speed, a file can be encrypted from 1/100 of a second up to 10 seconds. The encrypted file is then shown again to let you see the results. There is no need to save the encrypted file as it automatically saves itself and deletes the original file. No need to panic, as will be shown in the next paragraph.</P>

<P><A NAME="Deciphering">Deciphering a file</P>
<P></A>If you are given an encrypted file, you will need to know the password to decipher it. Remember, the program's passwords are case sensitive. That means, if the password is An9uUiop234, then it must be An9uUiop234. It cannot be an9uuiop234, or the deciphering will not work. After the correct password is entered, the file will be deciphered and brought back into the window for you to read.</P>
<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;----------&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>
<P><A NAME="Password">About the password</P>
<P></A>This is the most important part of the program. Passwords given can be of any length, use any character the keyboard makes (even foreign letters such as &eacute;, &szlig;, &uuml;, etc.). You can make an entire sentence if you want (considering you'll remember it later). It can be a mix of numbers and letters. If you can type it, it can be a password in this program.</P>
<P>The password can be of any length up to 255 characters long. Remember, it is case sensitive, therefore if there are any capital letters, they must be used in the password to decipher the file. It is advisable to use passwords that are more than 6 characters long, and make sure the person you are sending the file to knows the password for decipherment. Also, use different passwords for each file you encrypt, don't use the same one over and over again.</P>
<P>You can use all alphabetic characters, all numeric or a combination of both. Spaces and other signs and symbols can be used, therefore making a password an entire sentence if you'd like (providing you can remember it later). </P>
<P>The password is stored in the program's executable file, thus keeping it safe and away from plain view.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A NAME="Dont">DO NOT</A>:</P>
<P>1) DO NOT give your password to anyone that is not to read the information that has been encrypted.</P>
<P>2) DO NOT use common passwords that others might know (e.g. birthdays, maiden names, company names, Social Security Numbers, etc.)</P>
<P>3) DO NOT use a single letter as a password.</P>
<P>4) DO NOT use the same password for a different file.</P>
<P>5) DO NOT forget your password.</P>
<P>Passwords are case sensitive. That means, if the password is "The QUicK BroWN f67ox", then you must type in "The QUicK BroWN f67ox". Just typing "the quick brown f67ox" will not work and the program will not let you see the information. Therefore, the password you type or the password you give out MUST BE TYPED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.</P>
<P>For each file, DO NOT use the same password. For example, you encrypt five files, use five different passwords. This will keep things more secure.</P>
<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;----------&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A NAME="What">What files can be encrypted?</A></P>
<P>Almost any file that you have on your computer can be encrypted. That includes: Text files (from any word processing application like Microsoft Notepad or MS Word, Corel Word Perfect, Lotus, etc.), any image file (BMP, GIF, JPG, TIFF, WMF, PNP, etc), Spreadsheets (Excel, Fox Pro, Access, etc.)It is not recommended to encrypt system files (Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) for example) as you can make the entire computer temporarily unusable. Entire programs can be crippled by encrypting the ".EXE" file, but caution should be used when doing this also.</P>
<P>As mentioned above, this program was written with the business person in mind. It can, however, be used by private people to keep their files safe from intruding eyes. It is legal to send overseas, thus making international business files safe from the competition.</P>
<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;----------&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>
<P><A NAME="How">HOW SAFE IS THIS PROGRAM?</A></P>
<P>An encrypted message was given to 10 people from computer hackers to software analysts and computer programmers. Of those 10, a software analyst cracked the code in two weeks. The others haven't been able to as of this writing (after three months).</P>
<P>To ensure even better safety, when a file is encrypted, the following header is seen at the top of the encrypted message:</P>
<P>[Secret]0hDeg48SS</P>
<P>Take this out of the message (DO NOT permanently delete it!!) before e-mailing it, and send this header under a seperate e-mail, this is what the program needs to decipher the file. Getting the password to the recipient can be done through your own means (sent in a letter, over the phone or as a word/sentence in the middle of the e-mail message)</P>

<P>By installing and using this program, I cannot be held responsible for any problems you may have after installation. I am not responsible for forgotten passwords, accidently encrypted files or files where the code was cracked.</P>
<P>By installing and using this program, you are claiming responsibility for anything that may happen. I wrote this, designed it and tested it on four different systems and it worked well.</P>
<P>Thank you.</P></FONT></BODY>
