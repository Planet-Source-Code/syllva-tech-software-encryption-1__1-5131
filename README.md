## Encryption 1


</div>

### Description

This code is designed to show you how to encrypt any file you want, and keep it secret from 99% of the world's population. It's not 100% fool proof, but it is a powerful encryption. I'm now working on a version that will be stronger. If you're a hacker, or a code craker, let me know how it stood up to your cracking methods, I'm always interested in hearing about it.
 
### More Info
 
This code is not commented at all (sorry - I wrote it a couple of years ago for my own purposes. If you'd like comments, let me know and I'll give you full explanations).

If you encrypt the wrong file...your computer may not work...
